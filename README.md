## Description
This project is a small web application I created to practice programming in PHP. The frontend is created with regular HTML, CSS, and JS. The program takes an input from the user (a city name), and with the help of the OpenWeatherMap API, returns a short weather summary of the requested city back to the user. There is also a toggle button for a change in the background picture.
